1. on line 26 (<a href="{{route('donation.createPaymentInfoFromLogin', [) of 'donor-info-dialogue.blade.php' file we've set up our intended route in a login link
instead of login route. here we take advantage of laravel's redirecting to intended route in case of interruption for session expiration. that means if actully
we want to login first and then go to the intneded page. but laravel redirects to the intended route automaticlly. we didn't mention login route.

2. remove the comment from the two lines in login controller (two step verification code generation)
